# Clients

Information about hyrax client libraries and executables.

## Libraries

* [builtin][builtin] - This library is built into the hyrax server project since
 the server uses it to communicate with other hyrax nodes. It is still fit to be
 used by other projects, however.

## Executables

* [cli](/support/clients/cli) - A simple go script which is shipped with
  every hyrax release. It allows a user to interact with hyrax from the
  command-line. Also serves as a good example of how to use the
  [builtin][builtin] client library.

[builtin]: /client
